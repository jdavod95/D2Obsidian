To execute correct map layouts, you must understand your character's orienation to the map. Look at your character's

point of view of what's straight, left, or right. [It is never north, east, west, south.](http://i.imgur.com/q1PIey7.jpg) The correct direction will be based on

(1) if it exists, the map layout -- (2) the direction your character is facing whenever starting to explore the new area.

## Understanding The First Tile

Let's take the Underground Passage for example. To understand what is truly "straight" in context of the character's direction, you must consider the map's "first tile." Think of the map as a bunch of lego pieces put together; you want to identify the first one. I've done so in the screenshots below with the purple box.

The first tile will always have one single exit, and it's that direction that is your character's straight.  You'll want to literally follow that direction as much as possible as seen in the above screenshots. These are your winning map layouts!

But it cannot always be that black and white. You'll have to generally follow that direction at times, which means using your discretion. As seen in the above screenshots, you may have to take a few turns before you can return following the correct direction again.  In a worst case scenario, you may have to pick a direction that's completely perpendicular to what you need.
